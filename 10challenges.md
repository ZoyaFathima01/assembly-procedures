One of the biggest challenges was just getting the program to run in the first place. Between dealing with file permissions, weird white screens on Jupyter, and figuring out how to write the shell script, a lot of time went into setup before I could even test my code. Writing in assembly is also really unforgiving — one small mistake in a register or system call can break the whole thing, and there’s not much feedback when it does. I had to double-check syntax constantly and look up what each line actually did. Honestly, it took a lot of trial and error to get the logic right and make sure each letter printed correctly with a newline. The process made me appreciate how low-level this language is and how important each instruction becomes.
