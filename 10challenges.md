One of the main problems with this lab is linking the understanding of the theoretical concepts with the practice of making an assembly program work. Designing the logic was especially tricky because one needed to think about when to loop through the characters 'A' to 'Z' and how to make the output procedure reusable for other operations-the low-level thinking of assembly! Implementation posed another set of problems: registers had to be handled with care; the programmer had to call the system services correctly, and mistakes in memory allocation or referencing could cause a hiccup here or there. Debugging became really tricky since minuscule errors, like forgetting to save a register or incorrectly setting a syscall parameter, could produce very unintelligible error messages or hell-blank outputs. Overall, the lab demanded discipline, attention to detail, and patience to nail down every design phase into a working implementation.
